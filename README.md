Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.<br>
Sofware engineering is the designing, developing and maintenance of Software to solve problems in society.
It is important in Technology industry because it:
1.Enhances efficiency and productivity - by making code reusable hence preventing duplication of efforts and saving time.<br>
2.Improves data security - this is through best practices that secure data.<br>
3.Performance optimization - this is by ensuring software systems run efficiently and reliably.<br><br>

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.<br>
1.Emergence of structured programming - Such as waterfall model for systematic software development.<br>
2.Emergence of object oriented programming - This led to the use of more modular and reusable code.<br>
3.Emergence of Cloud computing - The adoption of cloud based platforms for software development such as AWS.<br>
4.Emergence of Artificial Intelligence(AI) AND Machine Learning(ML) - Integration of AI and ML into software applications such as chatbots and the use of these technologies in development as well.<br><br>

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.<br>
1.Planning - This is definition of the project scope, timelines and resource allocation.<br>
2.Requirements analysis - Gathering and documentation of user needs and system functionalities.<br>
3.Design - Creating the software architecture, system flow, and user interface design.<br>
4.Development - Coding and implementing the software based on the design.<br>
5.Testing - Verifying software functionality against requirements and identifying defects. This involves solving software bugs.<br>
6.Deployment - Releasing the software to the production environment.<br>
7.Maintenance - Addressing issues, bug fixes, and updates after deployement.<br><br>

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
